    Hello, 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; My name is Nick Garver and this is my side project that I have been working on for about a year now.  It has been a good deal of work but I have been having a blast and I think that I have learned quite a bit from it.  The goal of instasample was to make a 100% community generated website that people can come to when they have writers block, grab some quick samples for creativity, and get back to it.  I wanted to everything very straight forward because I personally felt like I would immediatly get lost in the sauce when I would go to browse samples and it is always such a pain in the ass to download things..login here, email that, verify this, badlkb kldfnlbld. So...here we are now.  The music production has given me so much I figured, why not do my part. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy <3
    <br>
